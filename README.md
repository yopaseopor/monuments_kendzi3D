# openpoimap

This is the code for version 1.29 of OpenPoiMap - aka **Taglocator**.
It is a tool to show on the OSM map a number of predefined POI's from a number of the standard OSM tagging scheme as defined
in the wiki at: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features.<br>
This tool is a user-friendly approach to the underlying database of OSM.<br>
In addition to this, it is possible to define your own key:value pairs to search for.<br>
I started working on this tool in november 2014.<br>
Update 1.29 (1 may 2018) relates to the https use of OSM.
I also removed the use of the compressed js-libraries for now.

Update 1.29a: a number of cosmetical edits to various parts of the sourcecode.

Also after a change of the overpass query format, an extra ";" became necessary to fix the normal working.

Update 1.29b: fixing userpois api semicolon issue
